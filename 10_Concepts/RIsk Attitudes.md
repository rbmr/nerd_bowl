### Risk Attitudes
An individual's attitude toward risk is determined by the curvature of their utility function regarding total wealth. 
#### Risk Averse
A risk-averse person always refuses a fair gamble. They prefer a certain outcome to a gamble with the same expected value. 
The utility function is concave in total wealth. 
This implies Diminishing [[Marginal Utility|Marginal Utility]] of wealth: as wealth increases, the slope of the utility function declines. 
#### Risk Seeking
A risk seeker prefers a fair gamble to a certain outcome. 
The utility function is [[Convexity|convex]] in total wealth -> The slope of the utility function increases with wealth.
#### Risk Neutral
A risk-neutral person is indifferent between accepting or refusing a fair gamble. 
Here, the marginal utility is constant. The expected utility of a gamble is exactly equal to the utility of the expected value.
