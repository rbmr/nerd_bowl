### Price Elasticity of Supply
**Definition:** A measure of the responsiveness of the quantity supplied to variations in price.
$$\epsilon^{S} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \frac{P}{Q}$$

Or geometrically:

$$\epsilon^{S} = \frac{P}{Q} \frac{1}{\text{slope}}$$

Where:
- $\epsilon^{S}$ is the Price Elasticity of Supply.
- $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$ represents the reciprocal of the slope of the supply curve (if plotted with P on the y-axis).

**Properties:**
- Because the [[Production Horizons|short-run]] supply curve is upward sloping (due to diminishing returns), the short-run elasticity is always positive.
- In the long-run, if the supply curve is horizontal, elasticity is infinite.
