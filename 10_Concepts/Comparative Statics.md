### Comparative Statics
Comparative statics is the analysis of how the optimal choice in an optimization problem responds to changes in the exogenous parameters (constraints or variables) of the model.

### Comparative Statics in Economics
In (micro)economics, specifically consumer theory, it examines how the consumer's optimal bundle changes when parameters such as prices, or income vary, while holding preferences constant. 

In the derivation of demand, comparative statics are analyzed through two primary constructs:
- **Price variation:** Analyzed via [[10_Concepts/Price-Consumption Curve]]
- **Income Variation:** Analyzed via [[10_Concepts/Income-Consumption Curve]]
