### Perfect Competition
Perfect Competition is an idealized market structutre characterized by specific axioms that result in firms having no influence over the market price of their product. While rarely satisfied in full, is serves as a foundation model for analyzing economic efficiency and response to price signals. 

#### Axioms
1. **Standardized Product (Homogeneity):** The product sold by one fit is considered a perfect substitute for the product sold by any other firm. Buyers are indifferent as to which firm they purchase from.
2. **Price-Taking Behavior:** Individual firms treat the market price as given. The firm believes its production decisions have a negligible impact on the aggregate market price. 
3. **Free Entry and Exit (Perfect Mobility):** In the [[Production Horizons|long run,]] factors of production are perfectly mobile. Firms can easily enter profitable industries, and exit unprofitable ones without significant barriers or costs.
4. **Perfect Information:** Consumers and firms have access to all relevant information regarding prices, product quality, and production opportunities. 

#### Demand Facing the Firm
- **Perfect Elasticity:** Under these conditions, the demand curve facing an individual firm is a horizontal line at the market [[Market Equilibrium]] price, $P^*$
- **Implication**: The firm can sell any Quantity it chooses at this equilibrium price, but if it changes, sales drop to zero. Charging less than the equilibrium price is irrational as it can already sell its desired output at the equilibrium price. 
- Market vs. Firm Demand: While the [[Market Demand]] curve is downward sloping, the individual firm's demand curve has infinite price elasticity.
