### Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution
The Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) is the rate at which one [[Factors of Production|production input]] canbe exchanged for another without altering the total level of output.

Geometrically, the MRTS at any point is the absolute value of the slope of the [[Isoquant]] passing through that point. 

The MRTS is defined as:
$$MRTS_{L,K} = \left| \frac{\Delta K}{\Delta L} \right| = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}$$
Where:
- $\Delta K$: Change in capital.
- $\Delta L$: Change in labour.
- $MP_L$: Marginal Product of Labour.
- $MP_K$: Marginal Product of Capital.

The MRTS is the slope of the isoquant, just as the [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] in Consumer Theory is the slope of the [[Indifference Curves]].
