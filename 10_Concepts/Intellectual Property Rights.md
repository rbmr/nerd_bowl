### Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual Property Rights, specifically Patents, are legal protections that confer the exclusive right to benefit from all exchanges involving an invention for a specified period. 

The cost of this is that it creates a [[Monopoly Market Structure|Monopoly]], which leads to higher prices for customers. 
The benefit is that it provides the economic incentive to recover high fixed costs of R&. Without this protection, competition would dive price to marginal cost, potentially stiffening innovation.
