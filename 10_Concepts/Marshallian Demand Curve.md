### Marshallian Demand Curve
The Marshallian Demand Curve (a.k.a. the ordinary or uncompensated demand curve) represents the quantity of a good a consumer chooses to buy at various prices, holding nominal income and the prices of other goods constant. 

It incorporates both the [[Income and Substitution Effects#Substitution effect|Substitution Effect]] and the [[Income and Substitution Effects#Income Effect|Income Effect]] of a price change.
It is the standard tool for predicting actual consumer behavior in response to price fluctuations.
