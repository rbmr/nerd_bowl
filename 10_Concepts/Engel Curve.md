### Engel Curve
The Engel Curve is a function that related the quantity demanded of a good to the consumer's level of income, holding prices and preferences constant. 
$$
Q_x = f(Y)
$$
Where:
- $Q_x$ is the quantity of good X demanded.
- $Y$ (or $M$) is the consumer's income.
#### Properties & Dynamics
- **Slope:** The slope of the Engel curve indicates the income elasticity of the good.
    - **Positive Slope:** Indicates a [[Normal vs. Inferior Goods|Normal Good]] (quantity increases with income).
    - **Negative Slope:** Indicates an [[Normal vs. Inferior Goods|Inferior Good]] (quantity decreases with income).
- **Linearity:** Engel curves may be linear but generally need not be.
