### Production Horizons
[[Production Theory|Production analysis ]]between time horizons based on the malleability of [[Factors of Production|input]] quantities, rather than strict calendar times. 

#### The Short Run
The Short Run is defined as the period during which one or more inputs cannot be varied. 
- **Fixed Input:** An input whose quantity cannot be altered (or only at prohibitive cost) within the given timeframe.
- **Variable Input:** An input whose quantity can be altered quickly.
- **Modeling Consequences:** In a two-input model ($K,L$), $K$ is typically held fixed at $K_{0}$. The production becomes a function of $L$ only. 

#### The Long Run
The Long Run is defined as the shortest period of time required to alter the amounts of **every** input.
- **Variability:** By definition, all inputs are variable in the long run.
- **Constraint:** The distinction is judgmental and varies by industry (e.g., window cleaning vs. ship building).
