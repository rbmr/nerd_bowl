### Substitutes and Complements
This concept defines the relationship between two goods based on how a price change in one affects the demand for the other.
1. **Complements:** Two goods are complements if an **increase** in the price of one good leads to a **decrease** in the demand for the other.
2. **Substitutes:** Two goods are close substitutes if an **increase** in the price of one good leads to an **increase** in the demand for the other.    
#### Mathematical Indication (Shift Dynamics)
- **Complements:** $\Delta P_{Good A} > 0 \implies \Delta Demand_{Good B} < 0$ (Leftward shift).
- **Substitutes:** $\Delta P_{Good A} > 0 \implies \Delta Demand_{Good B} > 0$ (Rightward shift).
