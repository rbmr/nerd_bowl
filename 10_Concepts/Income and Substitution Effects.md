### Income and Substitution Effects
The total effect of a price change on quantity demanded is decomposed into two distinct components: the substitution effect and the income effect. 
#### Substitution effect
- The change in the quantity demanded that results solely because the price change alters the attractiveness of substitute goods, holding the consumer's utility constant. 
- It is represented by a movement along the original [[Indifference Curves|indifference curve]] to a point where the slope is equal to the new price ratio. 
- The substitution effect always causes the quantity purchased to move in the opposite direction of the price change. 

#### Income Effect
- The change in quantity demanded that results from the change in purchasing power (real income) caused by the price change.
- It is represented by the movement from the hypothetical intermediate tangency to the final equilibrium bundle. 
- The direction of the change depends on whether the good is [[Normal vs. Inferior Goods|Normal or inferior]]. 

#### Method of Decomposition ([[10_Concepts/Hicksian Demand Curve|Hicksian]])
1. **Original Bundle:** Identify the optimal bundle ($A$) on the original budget ($B_0$) and indifference curve ($I_0$).
2. **Total Effect:** Identify the new optimal bundle ($D$) on the new budget ($B_1$). The movement $A \to D$ is the total effect.
3. **Hypothetical Budget ($B'$):** Construct a hypothetical budget line parallel to the _new_ budget ($B_1$) but tangent to the _original_ indifference curve ($I_0$). This tangency is point $C$.
4. **Decomposition:**
    - **Substitution Effect:** Movement $A \to C$.
    - **Income Effect:** Movement $C \to D$.
