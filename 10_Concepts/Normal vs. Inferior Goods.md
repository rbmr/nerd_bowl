### Normal vs. Inferior Goods
This concept categorizes goods based on how their [[Market Demand|demand]] responds to change sin consumer income.
1. **Normal Goods:** Goods for which the quantity demanded at any price rises as income rises. 
2. **Inferior Goods:** Goods for which the quantity demanded at any price falls as income rises. 
#### Economic Dynamics
**Normal Goods** represent the stand behaviour for most goods.
**Inferior goods** are consumed by consumers because of budget constraints. As income increases, consumers abandon these goods in favor for higher-quality substitutes.
