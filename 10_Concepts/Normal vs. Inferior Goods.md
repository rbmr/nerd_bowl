### Normal vs. Inferior Goods
This concept categorizes goods based on how their [[Market Demand|demand]] responds to changes in consumer income.
1. **Normal Goods:** Goods for which the quantity demanded at any price rises as income rises. 
2. **Inferior Goods:** Goods for which the quantity demanded at any price falls as income rises. 
#### Economic Dynamics
**Normal Goods** represent the stand behaviour for most goods.
**Inferior goods** are consumed by consumers because of budget constraints. As income increases, consumers abandon these goods in favor for higher-quality substitutes. 

#### Giffen Good
A Giffen good is a specific type of inferior good for which the total effect of a price increase is to _increase_ the quantity purchased.
##### Theoretical Conditions
For a good to be Giffen, two conditions must be met:
1. **Strongly Inferior:** The income effect must work in the opposite direction to the substitution effect.
2. **Dominant Income Effect:** The income effect must be large enough to overwhelm the [[Income and Substitution Effects|substitution effect]]. This typically requires the good to occupy a large share of the consumer's budget.

As a result, the demand curve for a giffen good is upward sloping. 

##### Illustrative Examples (Frank)
- **Irish Potato Famine:** The text cites the 19th-century potato famine as a theoretical example. Potatoes were a large budget item for the poor. A price rise reduced real income so drastically that families cut back on meat and bought _more_ potatoes.
