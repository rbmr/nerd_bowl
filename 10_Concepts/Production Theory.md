### Production Theory
Production is defined as any activity that creates present or future utility. It functions as a process that transforms inputs ([[10_Concepts/Factors of Production|factors of production]]) into outputs. 
The central mechanism describing this transformation is the [[10_Concepts/Production Functions|production function]], which embodies the existing state of technology to determine the maximum output achievable from a specific combination of inputs.
