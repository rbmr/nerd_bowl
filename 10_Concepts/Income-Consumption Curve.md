### Income-Consumption Curve
The Income-Consumption Curve (ICC) is the set of best affordable bundles traced out when the consumer's income changes, while holding preferences and relative prices constant. 

Given a utility function $U(X, Y)$ and budget constraint $M = P_X X + P_Y Y$:
The ICC is the locus of tangency points as $M$ takes values $\{m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n\}$ while $P_X$ and $P_Y$ remain fixed.
- **Mechanism:** A change in income shifts the budget constraint parallel to itself.
- **Slope:** The slope of the ICC reflects the nature of the goods (see [[Normal vs. Inferior Goods|normal goods]] and [[Normal vs. Inferior Goods|inferior goods]]).

#### Relationship to Engel Curve
The ICC contains the information required to construct the [[10_Concepts/Engel Curve]]. It maps the quantity demanded from the ICC against the corresponding income levels.
- **distinction:** The vertical axis of the ICC measures the amount spent on other goods (composite good), whereas the vertical axis of the Engel curve measures total income.
