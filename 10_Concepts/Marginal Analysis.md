### Marginal Analysis
This framework applies to decisions regarding the *extent* or *level* of an activity, e.g. "How much should I do?".

**Marginal Benefit ($MB$)**: The benefit derived from an additional unit of activity
**Marginal Cost($MC$)**: The cost incurred by an additional unit of activity.

To find the optimal quantity of an activity $x$, you should increase the level of activity as long as $MB(x)>MC(x)$ and decrease otherwise. The optimum is when $MB(x)=MC(x). 

#### Average-Marginal Distinction
- **The Trap:** Decision-makers often incorrectly compare _Average Benefit_ and _Average Cost_.
- **Correction:** An activity should be increased only if the _marginal_ benefit of the specific next unit exceeds its _marginal_ cost. It is possible for average benefit to be high while marginal benefit is lower than marginal cost.
