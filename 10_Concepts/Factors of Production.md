### Factors of Production
Factors of production are the tangible inputs used in the production process to generate output. Economic theory traditionally categorizes these into distinct classes:
- **Land:** Physical space and natural resources
- **Labour ($L$):** Human effort and time employed in production
- **Capital ($K$):** Physical assets such as equipment, machinery, and buildings.
- **Entrepreneurship:** The initiative to combine other resources productively.

Modern additions are:
- Knowledge
- Technology
- Organization
- Energy

#### Intermediate Products
Intermediate products are goods produced to be used as inputs for other goods. 
While often treated as inputs in simplified models, they differ from primary factors as they are transformed entirely into the finished product rather than providing a service over time.
