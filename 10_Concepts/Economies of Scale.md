### Economies of Scale
Economies of scale describe how [[Long-Run Cost Structure|long-run average costs]] (LAC) responds to proportional changes in the scale of production. It is distinct from diminishing returns, which is a [[Short-Run Cost Structure|short-run phenomenon]]. 

**Economies Of Scale**
- Output grows more than in proportion to inputs
- LAC Shape: downward sloping. LAC declines as output increases.

**Diseconomies of Scale**
- Ouput grows less than in proportion to inputs
- LAC Shape is upward slopeing. LAC rise as output increases. 

**Constant Returns to Scale**
- Output grows exactly in proportion to inputs
- LAC shape: Horizontal Line. Unit costs are constant regardless of scale. 

#### Minimum Efficient Scale (MES)
The lowest level of output at which the Long-Run Average Cost curve reaches it's minimum. 

If the MES is a large fraction of total market demand, a single firm is most efficient.
If the MES is a small fraction of market demand, the market can support many small firms.
