### Market Supply
Market supply represents the set of price-quantity pairs for which sellers are satisfied. "Satisfied" implies that at a given price, sellers are offering exactly the amount they wish to sell; they would consider themselves worse off if forced to sell more or less than that quantity at that price. 
The fundamental property is the **Law of Supply**: the quantity supplied rises as the price of the product rises. 

**Mathematical Representation**
- Standard Supply Function: $Q^s = g(P)$
- $Q^s$ is the quantity supplied.
- $P$ is the unit price.

**Structural Interpretation**
- **Horizontal**: Start with a price on the vertical axis to read the quantity sellers wish to sell on the Horizontal axis. 
- **Vertical Interpretation (Marginal Cost):** Start with a quantity on the horizontal axis to read the corresponding marginal cost on the vertical axis.
	- The price on the supply curve represents the **opportunity cost** of the last unit supplied by the marginal seller.
	- If the current quantity is $Q$, the supply curve indicates the marginal cost of delivering the $Q^{th}$ unit.
#### Determinants
The shift factors for the supply curve are:
- **Technology:** Improvements in technology reduce production costs, shifting the supply schedule to the right.
- **Factor Prices:** Costs of inputs (labor, capital, raw materials). A rise in factor prices (e.g., wage increases, equipment costs) shifts the supply schedule to the left.
- **Number of Suppliers:** An increase in the number of firms producing a good shifts the curve to the right.
- **Expectations:** If suppliers expect higher prices in the future, they may withhold current supply (shifting current supply left) to sell later at the higher price.
- **Weather:** particularly relevant for agriculture; adverse weather (drought) shifts supply to the left .

##### Shifts vs Movements
- **Change in Quantity Supplied:** A movement _along_ the supply curve caused by a change in the price of the good.
- **Change in Supply:** A shift of the entire supply curve caused by a change in a determinant other than the good's own price.
