### Lerner Index
The Lerner Index measures a form's market power by calculating the markup of price over [[Short-Run Cost Structure|marginal cost]] as a proportion of the price. 

Deriving from the [[Profit Maximization|Perfect Maximization]] condition $MR = MC$:
$$\frac{P - MC}{P} = \frac{1}{|\epsilon|}$$
Where $P$ is price, $MC$ is Marginal Cost, and $|\epsilon|$ is the absolute value of the [[Price Elasticity of Demand]].

As the elasticity of demand goes down, the markup increases. 
As elasticity approaches infinity, the markup approaches zero, implying perfect competition where $P=MC$.
