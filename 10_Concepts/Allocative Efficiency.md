### Allocative Efficiency
**Allocative Efficiency** occurs when resources are distributed such that the possibilities for mutual gains through exchange are fully exploited. It requires that the marginal benefit of the last unit consumed equals the marginal cost of producing it.
#### Short-Run Efficiency
In a competitive equilibrium, the market price ($P$) represents the value consumers place on the last unit. The marginal cost ($MC$) represents the value of resources used to produce it. Since competitive firms produce where $P = MC$:
$$\text{Value to Buyer} (P) = \text{Cost to Society} (MC)$$
This equality implies no further mutually beneficial trades exist.
#### Long-Run Efficiency
In the long run, competitive markets achieve efficiency on two dimensions
1. **Allocative:** $P = LMC$ (Price equals Long-Run Marginal Cost).
2. **Productive:** $P = \min(LAC)$. Output is produced at the lowest possible unit cost, minimizing resource waste.
