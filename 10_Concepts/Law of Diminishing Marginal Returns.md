### Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns is an empirical generalization stating that as equal amounts of a variable input are sequentially added while all other inputs are held fixed, the resulting increments to output ([[Marginal Product]]) will eventually diminish.
#### Constraints & Nuances
- **Short-Run Phenomenon:** The law applies strictly to the [[Production Horizons#The Short Run|short run]] where at least one input (like land or capital) is fixed.
- **Universality:** It applies even to [[Production Functions|production functions]] that exhibit increasing returns to scale in the long run. It describes a bottleneck created by the fixed input.

#### Negative Returns 
The law allows for the marginal product to eventually become negative (Total Product declines). Rational managers will never employ a variable input in the region where $MP<0$, nor past $MP=0$ (maximum output), provided the input has a positive cost.
