### Average Product
The Average Product $(AP)$ of a variable input is the total output divided by the quantity of that input. When the input is labor, this is commonly referred to as **labour productivity**. 

$$AP_L = \frac{Q}{L}$$
Where $Q$ is total output and $L$ is the quantity of the variable input.

Geometrically, the AP is at any level of Labor $L$ is the slope of the line draw from the origin to the corresponding point on the [[Total Product Curve]].

#### The Average-Marginal Relationship
The behavior of the AP curve is mathematically driven by the [[Marginal Product]]. 
- **$MP > AP$:** The $AP$ curve must be rising. Adding a unit with a contribution higher than the current average raises the new average
- **$MP < AP$:** The $AP$ curve must be falling. Adding a unit with a contribution lower than the current average lowers the new average
- **$MP = AP$:** The curves intersect at the maximum value of the Average Product curve
