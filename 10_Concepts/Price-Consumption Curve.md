### Price-Consumption Curve
The Price-Consumption Curve (PCC) is the set of optimal bundles traced out in an [[Indifference Curves|indifference curve]] diagram when the price of one good changes, while holding income, preferences, and the prices of all other goods constant. 

Given a [[Utility Theory|utility function]] $U(X,Y)$ and budget constraint $M=P_{X}X+P_{Y}Y$: The PCC is the locus of tangency points between the indifference curves and the budget constraints as $P_X$ varies ($P_X \in \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n\}$) while $P_Y$ and $M$ remain fixed.
- **Mechanism:** A change in the price of one good rotates the budget constraint outward (price decrease) or inward (price increase) along the axis of the good whose price changed.
- **Pivot Point:** The intercept on the axis of the good with the constant price (vertical intercept $M/P_Y$) remains fixed.

#### Relation to Demand
The PCC contains all of the necessary information to construct the [[10_Concepts/Individual Demand|individual demand]] curve. By recording the relevant price-quantity pairs from the PCC, one can map the quantity of the good demanded against its price.
