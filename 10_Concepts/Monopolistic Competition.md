### Monopolistic Competition
Monopolistic Competition is a market structure characterized by a large number of firms producing goods that are close, but not perfect, substitutes for one another. It is defined by two fundamental conditions:
1. **product Differentiation:** Each firms faces a downward sloping demand curve, because its product is distinct in the eyes of consumers, allowing it some degree of market-power
2. **Free Entry and Exit:** There are no barriers to entry, ensuring that in the long run, economic profits are driven to zero.

#### The Chamberlin Model
This model relies on a 'symmetric assumption': all firms in the industry face identical demand and cost functions. This implies that while an individual firm makes decision assuming its actions won't provoke a reaction, in reality, all firms share the same incentives and will likely adjust simultaneously.

#### Perceived vs. Actual Demand Curves
A critical feature of the Chamberlin model is the distinction between two [[Market Demand|demand curves]] facing the firm:
- The $dd$ curve (Perceived Demand): This curve describes the quantity a firm expects to sell at various prices, assuming all other firms keep their prices constant. It is highly elastic because if one firm alone cuts prices, it captures significant market share from rivals. 
- The $DD$ curve (actual/proportional demand): this curve describes the quantity a firm actually sells when all firms in the industry change prices simultaneously. It is less elastic (steeper) than the $dd$ curve, bacause no from captures customers from rivals; the change in quantity comes solely from the general market expansion or contraction.

#### Equilibrium Dynamics
##### Short-Run Equilibrium
The firm maximizes profit by equating Marginal Revenue with[[Short-Run Cost Structure| Short-run Marginal Cost]]. 
$$
MR_{dd}=MC
$$
The firm may earn positive economic profits if the price is greater than the Average Total Cost.
##### Long-Run Equilibrium (The Tangency Condition)
Positive profits attract new entrants, shifting the firm's $dd$ curve to the left (reducing the share of total market demand available to the firm)13. Entry continues until economic profits are zero.
- **Tangency Point:** Equilibrium occurs where the $dd$ curve is tangent to the Long-Run Average Cost ($LAC$) curve.
- **Conditions:**
    1. $MR = MC$ (Profit maximization).
    2. $P = LAC$ (Zero economic profit).
        
    3. $dd$ intersects $DD$ at the equilibrium price $P^*$.

#### The Excess Capacity Theorem
In the long-run equilibrium of monopolistic competition, firms do not produce at the minimum point of their Long-Run Average Cost ($LAC$) curve.
- **Inefficiency:** Because the demand curve ($dd$) is downward sloping, it must be tangent to the $LAC$ curve to the left of its minimum point.
- **Implication:** The industry is characterized by "excess capacity". Firms produce less output than the level that would minimize average costs. Ideally, fewer firms producing higher output would lower the total cost to society, but this would sacrifice product variety.
