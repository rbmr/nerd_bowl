### Market Equilibrium
In economic theory, Market Equilibrium is defined as the price-quantity pair at which both buyers and sellers are "satisfied". In this context, satisfaction implies that at the given price, all market participants are able to buy or sell the exact quantity they wish to transact.
- **Buyer Satisfaction:** Buyers are on their demand curve; they would consider themselves worse off if forced to buy more or less than the quantity demanded at that price.
- **Seller Satisfaction:** Sellers are on their supply curve; they would consider themselves worse off if forced to sell more or less than the quantity supplied at that price.
- **Geometric Definition:** Equilibrium is represented by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.

**The Equilibrium Condition**
The market is in equilibrium when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at a specific price $P^*$:
$$
Q^d(P^*) = Q^s(P^*)
$$
Where:
- $Q^d$ represents the Quantity Demanded function.
- $Q^s$ represents the Quantity Supplied function.
- $P^*$ represents the Equilibrium Price.
- $Q^*$ (the resulting quantity) represents the Equilibrium Quantity.

This solution is **[[10_Concepts/Pareto Optimality|Pareto Efficient]]**.
At this equilibrium, excess demand and excess supply are exactly zero. 

This standard model of Market Equilibrium assumes the axioms of [[Perfect Competition]].
