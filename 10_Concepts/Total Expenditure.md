### Total Expenditure
**Total Expenditure** ($R$) is the total amount of money consumers spend on a product at a given price and quantity combination. From the seller's perspective, this is equivalent to Total Revenue.
$$R = P \cdot Q$$
Where:
- $R$: Total Expenditure (Revenue).
- $P$: Price per unit.
- $Q$: Quantity demanded.
#### Elasticity-Expenditure Relationship
The effect of a price change on total expenditure depends strictly on the [[Price Elasticity of Demand|price elasticity of demand]]. The change in expenditure is the net result of the gain from additional sales versus the loss from a lower price per unit.
- **Elastic Demand ($|\epsilon| > 1$):** A price reduction **increases** total expenditure. A price increase reduces it.
- **Inelastic Demand ($|\epsilon| < 1$):** A price reduction **reduces** total expenditure. A price increase increases it.
- **Unit Elastic Demand ($|\epsilon| = 1$):** Total expenditure is at a mathematical **maximum**. Small price changes do not increase revenue.
