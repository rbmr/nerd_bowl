### Economic Profit
Economic Profit is defined as the difference between total revenue and [[Short-Run Cost Structure|total cost]], where total cost comprises both explicit costs and implicit costs associated with the resources utilized by the firm.

This differs fundamentally from [[10_Concepts/Accounting Profit|Accounting Profit]], which is defined strictly as total revenue minus explicit costs. The inclusion of implicit costs in economic profit accounts for the [[Opportunity Cost]] of resources, the value of the best alternative use of those resources. 

The calculation for economic profit ($\Pi$) is expressed as:
$$\Pi = TR - TC_{total}$$
$$\Pi = TR - (C_{explicit} + C_{implicit})$$
Where:
- $TR$ represents Total Revenue.
- $TC_{total}$ represents Total Cost (Explicit + Implicit).
- $C_{explicit}$ represents out-of-pocket expenditures (e.g., wages, rent).
- $C_{implicit}$ represents opportunity costs (e.g., forgone interest on capital, forgone wages of owner-labor).
