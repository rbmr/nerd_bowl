### Linear Production Function
A **Linear Production Function** represents a production process where [[Factors of Production|inputs]] are **Perfect Substitutes**. One input can be substituted for another at a constant rate regardless of the level of inputs used.

#### Mathematical Formulation
While the text graphically represents this, the implied functional form for perfect substitutes is:
$$Q = aK + bL$$
#### Properties & Dynamics
- **Isoquant Shape:** [[Isoquant]]s are straight downward-sloping lines.
- **Constant [[Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution|MRTS]]:** The Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution remains constant along the entire isoquant.
- **Substitutability:** A specific quantity of one input can always replace a specific quantity of another without affecting output (e.g., 1 unit of $A$ always replaces 1 unit of $B$).
