### Pricing Strategies
**Pricing Strategies** in microeconomics refer to methods used by firms to set prices for goods and services, often with the intent of capturing a larger portion of the potential gains from trade (Consumer Surplus) than would be possible under uniform marginal cost pricing.

#### Key Approaches
- **[[Two-Part Tariff|Two-Part Pricing]]:** Charging a fixed fee plus a per-unit fee.
- **Fixed Admission:** Charging only an entry fee with zero marginal cost for usage (e.g., amusement parks).
