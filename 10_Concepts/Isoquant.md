### Isoquant
An Isoquant is defined as the set of all possible combinations of [[Factors of Production|variable inputs]] that yield a specific, constant level of output. 

Mathematically, for a production function $Q = F(K, L)$, an isoquant for output level $Q_0$ is the locus of points satisfying:
$$F(K, L) = Q_0$$

#### Properties & Dynamics
- **Cardinal Significance:** Unlike [[Indifference Curves]] in consumer theory (where labels merely indicate relative ranking), the number assigned to an isoquant corresponds to the actual, quantifiable level of output produced by the input bundles along that curve.
- **Monotonicity (Direction):** Any input bundle on an isoquant yields more output than any bundle lying below it and less output than any bundle lying above it. This implies isoquants generally slope downward (assuming positive marginal products).
- **Analogous to [[Indifference Curves]]:** The isoquant map describes the technical properties of production exactly as an indifference map describes a consumer's preferences.
- **Mapping to [[Production Functions]]:** To generate an isoquant curve, one fixes $Q$ at a specific value and solves for one variable in terms of the other (e.g., solving for $K$ in terms of $L$).
