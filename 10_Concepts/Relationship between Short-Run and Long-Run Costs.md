### Relationship between Short-Run and Long-Run Costs
The relationship between [[Short-Run Cost Structure|short-run]] and [[Long-Run Cost Structure|long-run costs]] is defined by the flexibility of capital. The LAC curve represents the lower boundary of all possible ATC curves, each corresponding to a different fixed level of capital. 

**The envelope relationship**
The LAC curve is the envelope of the family of short-run ATC curves. 
For any output level $Q$, the firm in the long run chooses the specific plant size that minimizes the ATC for that $Q$. 
The ATC curve for a specific capital level will lie above the LAC curve everywhere except at the single output level where the capital is optimal.

**Tangency Points & Equality Condition**
At the specific output level ($Q^*$) where the fixed capital stock ($K^*$) is the long-run optimal amount:
1. **Tangency:** The short-run ATC curve is tangent to the long-run LAC curve.
2. Equality:
$$LMC = SMC = ATC = LAC$$
    Note: This specific four-way equality holds only at the minimum point of the LAC curve (if the LAC is U-shaped). For tangency points on the downward or upward sloping sections of LAC, $ATC = LAC$ and $SMC = LMC$, but they do not all equal each other.
3. **Steepness:** The SMC curve is always steeper than the LMC curve at the point of intersection. This reflects that adjusting output is more costly in the short run (constrained) than in the long run (unconstrained).
