### Cost-Benefit Analysis
This framework applies to binary decisions.

**The Algorithm (Decision Rule):**
Let $B(x)$ denote the benefits of doing activity $x$ and $C(x)$ denote the costs.
$$\text{If } B(x) > C(x), \text{ do } x; \text{ otherwise don't.}$$
- **Benefit $B(x)$:** Defined as the maximum monetary amount an individual would be willing to pay to do $x$. This is often a hypothetical magnitude if no money changes hands.
- **Cost $C(x)$:** Defined as the value of all resources that must be given up to do $x$.

**Reservation Price**
The threshold amount at which a person is indifferent between doing and not doing an activity.
- For costs, it is the minimum amount one would accept to perform the action
- For benefits, it is the maximum amount one would pay to achieve the result

#### Framing
When comparing costs and benefits, one must measure them in absolute monetary terms, not as percentages. 
The should be compared using their absolute values, not proportionally.
