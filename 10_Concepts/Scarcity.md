### Scarcity
Scarcity is the condition where resources are insufficient to satisfy all wants. It is the fundamental problem that necessitates choice. 
- **Universality**: Scarcity applies to everyone, such as time, energy, and physical capacity. 
- **No Free Lunch**: Because resources are scarce, having more of one thing necessarily means having less of something else. Using time for X, means not using that time for Y.
- **Non-Monetary Scarcity**: Scarcity applies to non-monetary resources, such as the capacity of a stomach at an "all-you-can-eat" buffet. The choice is still economic because eating one item reduces the capacity to eat another.
