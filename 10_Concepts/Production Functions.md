### Production Functions
The production function is a mathematical relationship describing how inputs are combined to produce output. It defines the maximum quantity of output that can be produced from given quantities of inputs, given the current state of technology. 

The Production Function is essentially the [[Utility Theory|utility function]] of firms / in [[Production Theory]].

In a simplified two-input model, the function is expressed as:
$$Q = F(K, L)$$
Where:
- $Q$: The quantity of output (e.g., meals per week).
- $K$: The quantity of capital input (e.g., equipment-hours per week).
- $L$: The quantity of labour input (e.g., person-hours per week).
- $F$: The mathematical rule summarizing the transformation process.
