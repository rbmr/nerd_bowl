### Network Effects
Network Effects function as a demand-side counterpart to [[Economies of Scale]], occurring when the value of a product to an individual consumer increases as the total number of users increases. 

These effect can act as a [[Monopoly Market Structure|Monopoly]] Barrier. Once a product passes a critical usage threshold, the advantages become compelling, making the dominant standard insuperable. 

These economies can also be interpreted as a feature of product quality.
