### Rational Choice Theory
This is the framework to study how people choose under conditions of [[Scarcity]]. It assumes that individuals try to maximize their goals by weighing costs and benefits. 
#### Home Economicus
A stereotypical decision-maker in the self-interest model who cares only about personal material costs and benefits. However , the text notes that this is a caricature; the cost-benefit model can also accomdate non-egoistic motives if the person values helping others.

#### As-if thesis
Economists do not assume people explicitly calculate costs and benefits for every action. Instead they assume people act as if they made such calculations. 

> Just as expert pool players obey the laws of physics without knowing the formal equations, people absorb the rules of rational decision-making through trial and error.

Economic models should be judged by how well they predict behaviour, not by the realism of their assumptions.
