### Price Indices
A Price Index is a normalized average of price relatives for a given class of goods or services in a given region, during a given interval of time. It serves as a statistical metric to estimate the changing cost of maintaining a specific standard of living of purchasing power over time. 

The calculation generally involves:
1. **Reference Period:** Establishing a base year/period where the cost of a bundle is normalized.
2. **Representative Bundle:** Determining a collection of goods and services that represent typical consumption.
3. **Aggregation:** Computing the current cost, relative to the reference cost
