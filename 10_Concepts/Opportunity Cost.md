### Opportunity Cost
The opportunity cost of an activity is the value of the most highly values alternative that must be forgone to pursue that activity. 

#### Implicit Costs
These are costs that are not explicit monetary payments but represent lost value
> If a student attends university, the cost includes tuition (explicit), plus the earning forgone by not working (implicit / opportunity cost)

#### Reciprocity
Costs and benefits are reciprocal. Not incurring a cost is the same as receiving a benefit. 
> If  a job is unpleasant and you would pay $30 to avoid it, then not doing that job carries an indirect benefit of $30.
