### Hicksian Demand Curve
The **Hicksian Demand Curve** (also known as the income-compensated demand curve) represents the quantity of a good a consumer would buy at various prices if they were simultaneously compensated with enough income to maintain their original level of satisfaction (utility).
#### Components
- **[[Income and Substitution Effects#Substitution effect|Substitution effect]] Only:** By compensating for the income change, this curve isolates the pure substitution effect.
- **Construction:** It is always constructed relative to a fixed reference point (a specific indifference curve, $I_0$).
#### Slope Relative to Marshallian Demand
The relationship between the slopes of the [[Marshallian Demand Curve]] and the Hicksian curve depends on the nature of the good:
- **[[Normal vs. Inferior Goods|Normal Goods]]:** The Hicksian demand curve is **steeper** than the Marshallian demand curve.
    - _Reasoning:_ For a price increase, the income effect (being poorer) further reduces consumption, reinforcing the substitution effect. Removing the income effect (Hicksian) leads to a smaller reduction in quantity than the uncompensated (Marshallian) scenario.
- **[[Normal vs. Inferior Goods|Inferior Goods]]:** The Hicksian demand curve is **flatter** (less steep) than the Marshallian demand curve.
    - _Reasoning:_ For a price increase, the income effect (being poorer) increases consumption (definition of inferior), opposing the substitution effect. The ordinary demand curve therefore shows a smaller quantity reduction than the compensated curve.
