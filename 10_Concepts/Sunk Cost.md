### Sunk Cost
Sunk costs are costs that are beyond recovery at the moment a decision is made. 
Sunk costs must be **ignored** in decision making. 
$$
\text{Total Cost}=\text{Varibalke COsts (Relevant)} + \text{Sunk Costs(Irrelevant)}
$$
>When deciding between driving and taking a train, costs like insurance and interest on the car are sunk (they are paid regardless of whether the trip is taken). Only fuel, maintenance and ticket costs that directly follow from the trip should be taken into account.
