### Economic Methodology
#### Economic Questions
##### Positive Questions
These deal with "what is." They have definitive answers and concern consequences, specific policies, or institutional arrangements.    
> "What will happen to the price of fish?" or "How will employment be affected?".
##### Normative Questions
These deal with "what ought to be." They involve value judgments and cannot be answered solely by economic analysis.    
> "Is it important to preserve the fishing industry?" or "Who should be prioritized for healthcare?" .

#### Scopes of Economics
- **Microeconomics:** The study of individual choices and the behavior of groups in individual markets.
- **Macroeconomics:** The study of broader aggregations of markets, such as national unemployment rates, the overall price level, and total national output.
