### Monopoly Pricing Strategy
A monopolist's pricing strategy is derived from the objective to maximize economic profit. Unlike a competitive firm, the monopolist influences market price and must reduce price to increase sales, making its total revenue curve non-linear. 
- [[Profit Maximization]]: the firm chooses output where the difference between Total Revenue and [[Short-Run Cost Structure|Total Cost]] is greatest.
- Supply Rule: A monopolist does not have a supply curve. Instead, it follows a rule to equate Marginal Revenue with Marginal Cost. 
- The price is determined by the demand curve at the profit maximizing quantity, not by adding a fixed margin to cost arbitrarily.
