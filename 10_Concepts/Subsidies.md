### Subsidies
A subsidy is a payment from the government to a buyer or seller, functioning analytically as a "negative tax". 

Like with [[Tax Incidence]], the economic benefit of a subsidy is independent of its legal assignment (whether paid to buyer or seller). The distribution of benefits depends on the relative slopes ([[Price Elasticity of Demand|elasticities]]) of the supply and demand curves.

The benefit of the subsidy accrues mostly to the side of the market with the steep (less elastic) curve.
