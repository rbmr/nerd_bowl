### Natural Monopoly Regulation
**Natural Monopoly Regulation** involves government intervention to correct the [[Allocative Efficiency|allocative inefficiency]] ($P > MC$) inherent in markets characterized by declining long-run average costs.
In a n[[Natural Monopoly]], [[Short-Run Cost Structure|Marginal Cost]] (MC) is below [[Short-Run Cost Structure|Average Total Cost (ATC)]]. Forcing the firm to charge the efficient price ($P=MC$) results in economic losses, necessitating subsidies or causing bankruptcy.

#### Regulatory Approaches
1. **State Ownership:** The government owns the firm, sets $P=MC$, and absorbs losses through general tax revenues. _Drawback:_ Potential for [[X-Inefficiency]] due to weak cost-cutting incentives.
2. **State Regulation (Price Caps):** Private ownership with government price controls.
    - _Average Cost Pricing:_ Sets $P=ATC$, allowing zero economic profit but failing to achieve strict efficiency ($P>MC$).
    - _Information Asymmetry:_ Regulators often lack accurate cost data, leading to "gold-plating" where firms overstate costs to secure higher prices.
3. **Franchise Bidding (Exclusive Contracting):** Based on Harold Demsetz's theory. The government specifies the service and solicits competitive bids for the right to be the sole provider. The lowest bidder wins. This replaces regulation with competition _for_ the market.
4. **Antitrust Enforcement:** Prevents abuse of dominant positions (e.g., Article 102 of the EU Treaty). However, breaking up a natural monopoly can increase production costs due to lost scale economies.
5. **Laissez-Faire:** Doing nothing. Preferred if the efficiency/fairness loss is minimal (e.g., luxury goods) or if the monopolist employs the [[Hurdle Model]] to serve price-sensitive buyers.
