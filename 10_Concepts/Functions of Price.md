### Functions of Price
In a free market economy, prices serve two distinct, but complementary functions that coordinate the behavior of buyers and sellers. :
1. The Rationing Function
2. The Allocative Function

#### Rationing Function
The rationing function of price is the **short-run** process by which market equilibrium prices curtail excessive claims on scarce resources, ensuring that the quantity demanded equals the fixed quantity available.
- **Mechanism:** Equilibrium prices filter demand, rationing the available supply to those buyers with the highest reservation prices (willingness to pay).
- **Condition:** This function operates on the distribution of output that _already exists_.

#### Allocative Function
The allocative function of price is the **[[Production Horizons|long-run]]** process whereby prices act as signals that induce resources to migrate across different sectors of the economy.
- **Signaling Mechanism:**
    - **Excess Demand (High Prices):** When firms can charge more than the cost of production, the resulting **profits** act as a "carrot," luring additional resources (capital, labor) into the industry.
    - **Excess Supply (Low Prices):** When prices fall below production costs, the resulting **losses** act as a "stick," driving resources out of the industry.
- **Result:** This migration continues until excess demand or supply is eliminated.
