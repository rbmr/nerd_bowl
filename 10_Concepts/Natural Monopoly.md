### Natural Monopoly
A Natural Monopoly is a market structure in which the entire market demand is most cost-efficiently served by a single firm rather than by two or more firms. This occurs when the [[Long-Run Cost Structure|Long-Run Average Cost (LAC)]] is declining throughout the relevant range of production. 

A single firm produces the industry output at a lower average cost than if the output were divided among multiple firms.
Natural monopolies driven by [[Economies of Scale]] are generally more durable than those driven by input control or patents.
