### Monopoly Market Structure
A Monopoly is a market structure characterized by a single seller of a product or service for which there are no close substitutes, resulting in the firm serving the entire market. Unlike perfect competition, where firms are price takers, a monopolist possesses significant market power and faces the downward-sloping market demand curve directly. 
- Unlike [[Perfect Competition]], monopolies often charge different prices to different groups -> [[10_Concepts/Price Discrimination]]
- A monopolist has no well-defined supply curve. There is no unique correspondence between price and quantity supplied; instead the firm applies a 'supply rule' equating marginal revenue to marginal cost. 
- The classification of a monopoly depends heavily on the definition of 'close substititutes'. This is empirically measured using the [[Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand]].

#### Barriers to Entry
Barriers to entry are economic or legal obstacles that prevent new competitors from easily entering a market or industry, thereby allowing firms to maintain monopoly power. 

##### Types of Barriers
- **Exclusive Control over Important Inputs:** A firm controls a key resource that cannot be easily duplicated by competitors.
- **[[Economies of Scale]]:** When the long-run average cost curve is downward sloping, a single firm can serve the market at a lower cost than multiple firms.
- **[[Intellectual Property Rights]] (Patents):** Legal protections that confer the exclusive right to benefit from exchanges involving invention.
- **[[Network Effects]] (Network Economies):** A condition where a product becomes more valuable as the number of consumers using it increases.
- **Government Licenses:** Laws preventing anyone but a government-licensed firm from doing business in a specific market.
