### Total Product Curve
The Total Product (TP) Curve represents the [[Production Horizons#The Short Run|short-run]] production function. It relates the total amount of output to the quantity of the variable input, holding all other inputs fixed.
$$Q = F(K_0, L)$$
#### Properties & Dynamics
- **Origin:** The curve passes through the origin; zero variable input yields zero output.
- **Convexity (Increasing Returns):** Initially, the curve may rise at an increasing rate (convex shape). This is attributed to benefits from division of labor and specialization.
- **Concavity (Diminishing Returns):** Beyond a certain point, the curve rises at a decreasing rate (concave shape), reflecting the [[Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns]].    
- **Decline:** The curve may eventually peak and slope downward, indicating that additional units of the variable input reduce total output (negative returns).
- **Shift:** An increase in the fixed input ($K$) rotates the TP curve upward.
