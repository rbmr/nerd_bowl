### Long-Run Cost Structure
In the long-run, all inputs are variable. The firm can adjust its scale of operations completely. The long-run cost structure represents the lowest cost of producing each output level when the firm is free to choose the optimal input mix for that specific output. 

#### Expansion Path
The expansion path is the locus of all cost-minimizing input bundles (tangency points between [[Isocost Line]]s and [[Isoquant]]s) as the level of output increases, holding [[Factors of Production|input]] prices fixed. 

#### Long-Run Total Cost (LTC)
The LTC curve is derived directly from the Expansion Path. It plots the total cost associated with each optimal bundle on the expansion path against the corresponding output quantity. 

The LTC always passes through the origin, as everything can be liquidated.

#### Long-Run Marginal Cost
The change in LTC as output expands by one unit. It is the slope of the LTC Curve. 

#### Long-Run Average Cost
Total cost per unit of output when all inputs are optimized.
$$LAC_Q = \frac{LTC_Q}{Q}$$
