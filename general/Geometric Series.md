- A geometric sequence is an ordered list of non-zero numbers where you get from one term to the next by multiplying by a common ratio $r$.
    - $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \dots$
- A finite geometric series is the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence.
    - Definition: $S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{n-1}$
    - Rule: $S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 -r}$ for $r \neq 1$
    - Derivation:
        - $S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{n-1}$
        - $rS_n = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \dots + ar^n$
        - $S_n - rSn  =  a - ar^n$
        - $S_n(1-r) = a(1-r^n)$
        - $S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 -r}$  for $r \neq 1$
- An infinite geom  etric series is the sum of all terms of a geometric sequence.
    - Definition: $S_\infty = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots$
    - Rule: The series only has a finite sum if the common ratio is close to zero.
        - If $|r| < 1$ the series converges. $S_\infty = \frac{a}{1 - r}$
        - If $|r| \geq 1$ the series diverges. The sum goes to infinity, or oscillates indefinitely.
    - Derivation: Trivial given $S_\infty = \lim_{n\to \infty} S_n$
