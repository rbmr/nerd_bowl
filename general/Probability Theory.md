Events
- Experiment: Any action whose outcome is subject to uncertainty.
- Sample space $S$: The set of all outcomes of an experiment.
- Event $A$: collection of outcomes, $A \subseteq S$. 
	- Simple if only one outcome, compound otherwise.
	- We say $A$ occurs, when an outcome belongs to $A$. 
- Events are mutually exclusive if $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
- Events $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are said to be mutually exclusive if they are pairwise mutually exclusive, i.e., if $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ whenever $i \neq j$.
