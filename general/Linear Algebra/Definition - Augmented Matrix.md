A linear system can be represented by an **augmented matrix**. This matrix is formed using the coefficients of the variables and the constants on the right-hand side of the equations. The names of the variables are not essential for this representation.

### Example
The system:
$x_1 + 5x_2 + 3x_3 = 1$
$2x_1 + x_2 + 15x_3 = 8$
$-x_1 + x_2 + 3x_3 = 1$

Corresponds to the augmented matrix:
$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\
2 & 1 & 15 & 8 \\
-1 & 1 & 3 & 1
\end{array}\right]$$
