In a linear system, variables are classified based on the [[Definition - Echelon Form|echelon form]] of its [[Definition - Augmented Matrix|augmented matrix]]:

* **Basic Variable:** A variable whose corresponding column contains a pivot position.
* **Free Variable:** A variable whose corresponding column does not contain a pivot position.

### Properties
* A [[Definition - Consistent and Inconsistent System|consistent system]] is solved by expressing the basic variables in terms of the free variables.
* If a consistent system has no free variables, it has a unique solution.
* If a consistent system has at least one free variable, it has infinitely many solutions.
