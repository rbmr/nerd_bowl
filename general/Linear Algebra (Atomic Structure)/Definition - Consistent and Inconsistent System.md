A system of linear equations is called:
* **Consistent** if it has at least one solution (this can be one solution or infinitely many).
* **Inconsistent** if it has no solution at all.

### Properties
* An inconsistent system, when subjected to [[Definition - Elementary Row Operations|row reduction]], will produce at least one row of the form `[0 0 ... 0 | c]` where `c` is a nonzero constant.
