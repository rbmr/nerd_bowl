A matrix is in **echelon form** if it satisfies three properties:

a.  All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros.
b.  Each **leading entry** (or **pivot**) of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.
c.  All entries in a column below a leading entry (pivot) are zero.
