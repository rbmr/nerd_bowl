# Course Information

### Study Goals
The course is an undergraduate course in microeconomics. It is an introduction to basic concepts and paradigms of modern microeconomics theory that covers the following topics:
- Individual Choice, including consumer choice and producer choice.
- Introduction to Game Theory.
- Choice under uncertainty.
- Competitive markets.
- Monopoly.
- Oligopoly.
- General Equilibrium.

The course begins with a short introduction to microeconomics (Part 1 of the textbook). Then, it proceeds to the theory of consumer behavior (Part 2) and the theory of the firm and market structure (Part 3). It concludes with an introduction to General Equilibrium Theory and Externalities (Part 5).

The course aims to provide students with a foundational understanding of basic microeconomic concepts and paradigms. After completing the course, students:
- Understand and can explain how individuals and firms make decisions and interact.
- Understand and can explain how individuals and firms behave in markets and how these markets operate.
- Can compute the rational behavior of an individual and a firm.
- Can compute the outcome of market equilibrium.
- Can compute the equilibrium outcome in the presence of strategic interactions.
- Understand the underlying assumptions behind the theories studied in the course and the limitations of these theories.
- Know the mathematical tools necessary for developing microeconomics theories and can apply them in case studies and exercises.
