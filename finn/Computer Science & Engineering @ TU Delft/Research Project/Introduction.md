**Preference selection**

You must make a preference ranking of at least 5, but up to 25 is recommended.

You can make a group of 5, and then this will be taken into consideration when assigning the project. Groups of 4 or less will not be taken into consideration for assigning project (but you can try to have the exact same rankings) (DONT FORGET TO PRESS SAVE)

*Robert: We will already be put in our proposed project automatically, but still select it as number 1 to be sure. If no one selects our project, we will be assigned to other projects.*

**Alloc Algo**

Random alloc, allocate groups, worst-off student will get a place in their most preferred projects, minimize average preference ranking number
