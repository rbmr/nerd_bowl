# Software Engineering and AI Testing

# Course Information

### Study Goals

How do you know and assess whether an AI-intensive system is working as intended? On the one hand, quality assurance for such systems can be considered to be a software testing challenge; in parallel, the machine learning components within such systems are normally validated according to machine learning-specific evaluation methodology.

In this course, you will learn more about these two complementary takes to evaluation and quality assurance, while learning about (and getting hands-on experience in) state-of-the-art advances in combining these two takes.

Course content taught includes:

- Basics of testing (assertions, white-box vs. black-box testing)
- Basics of machine learning evaluation (validation en validity)
- Quality assurance at different scopes in AI-intensive systems (models, components, systems, cyber-physical systems)
- Adversarial attacks
- Software testing techniques (e.g. fuzzing, metamorphic testing, combinatorial testing, differential testing)
- Data labels (ground truth/oracle) validation

At the end of this course, the student is able to:

1. Apply state-of-the-art techniques to test and validate machine learning models and training routines
2. Improve robustness considerations in AI-intensive systems upon analysis of their current workings
3. Implement techniques to generate application- and context-specific adversarial attacks
4. Connect the oracle problem in software testing to questions of experimental validity in ground truth
5. Complement classical evaluation reporting of machine learning models with insights obtained through testing

### Assessment

The final grade of the course consists of the following components:

- Group Report (weighting 70%)
- Digital Exam (weighting 30%)

Final grade calculation = 0.7 * Group Report + 0.3 * Digital Exam

A passing final grade for the course can only be earned when for all components at least a 5.0 is earned, and the weighted final grade is at least a 5.8.

In case of an insufficient final result, repair options may exist in accordance with Article 17A, Times and number of examinations, sub 1, of the Teaching and Examination Regulations, for:

- Group Report: Repair opportunity
- Digital Exam: Resit opportunity

Disclaimer: information may change depending on unforeseen circumstances or measures (see: TER Art 2, sub 5).
