# Elements of Statistical Learning

# Course Information

### Study Goals

This course covers all the basic concepts of Statistical Learning, focusing on the classical techniques of Machine Learning before the era of Deep Learning. These concepts include classification, (ridge) regression, (hierarchical) clustering, feature reduction and extraction, model selection and bootstrapping, fairness in ML. The emphasis is on the concepts rather than the mathematical details.

At the end of this course, the student is able to:

1. Explain the fundamental concepts and assumptions in the field of Statistical Learning, like the classical supervised learning, but also regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction
2. Reflect on the strengths and limitations of classical and modern Statistical Learning techniques.
3. Apply the covered learning techniques to analyse a dataset and reason about their effectiveness

### Assessment

The final grade of the course consists of the following components:

- Digital Exam: weblab exam (weighting 70%)
- Group Report: project report on analysis of a dataset (weighting 30%)

Final grade calculation = 0.7 * Digital Exam + 0.3 * Group Report

A passing final grade for the course can only be earned when for all components at least a 5.0 is earned, and the weighted final grade is at least a 5.8.

In case of an insufficient final result, repair options may exist in accordance with Article 17A, Times and number of examinations, sub 1, of the Teaching and Examination Regulations, for:

- Digital Exam: Resit opportunity
- Group Report: Repair opportunity

Disclaimer: information may change depending on unforeseen circumstances or measures (see: TER Art 2, sub 5).
