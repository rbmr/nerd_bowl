Cost benefit 
- Every choice involves important elements of scarcity. Coping with scarcity is the essence of the human condition. After all, without scarcity, no decision would matter.
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: When determining to do activity $x$, you should do $x$ if the benefits $B(x)$ outweigh the costs $C(x)$. A cost-benefit analysis can be very complex.
- **Opportunity cost** of $x$ is the cost of no longer being able to do some other activity $y$ as consequence of doing $x$.
- **Sunk costs** are costs that are beyond recovery at the moment the decision is made, unlike opportunity costs, these costs should be ignored.
- Costs and benefits are measured absolutely, not relatively. 
- **Marginal analysis**: Frequently the choice is not whether to perform the action, but the degree to which it should be performed. We must then repeatedly compare the benefit (marginal benefit) and cost (marginal cost) of an additional unit of activity.
	- Note the average (marginal) benefit, or average (marginal) cost, is not perse equal to the marginal cost or benefit for an additional unit of activity.

Definition of Economics
- A positive question is one that has a definitive answer. A normative question is a question that does not have a definitive answer. It is a question that involves value judgements about what ought to be or what should be. Economic analysis can only answer the former, the latter is for society to decide.
- Study of individual choices, and the study of groups in individual markets fall under microeconomics. Macroeconomics is the study of broader aggregations of markets. Economists are much better at predicting individual markets than the economy as a whole.

Supply and Demand
- A market consists of the buyers and sellers of a good or service.
- Sometimes the choice of market definition will depend on the bias of the observer. 
	- EU competition law attempts to prevent mergers between companies that would impede competition. A measure of competition is market share, the European Commission may therefore define markets narrowly making the combined market share as large as possible.
	- Two otherwise identical products are often classified as separate if they differ only with respect to the times or places they are available. For example: umbrella on a sunny day vs umbrella during rain.
- The **demand curve** describes the quantity of a good or service buyers wish to purchase at various possible prices, holding all else constant. We notice as price falls, quantity demanded increases (law of demand).
- The **supply curve** describes the quantity of a good or service suppliers are willing to supply at various possible prices, holding all else constant. We notice as price increases, quantity supplied increases (law of supply).
- Suppose we view the supply and demand curves as the set of price-quantity pairs for which suppliers and buyers are satisfied. Buyers are willing to buy the same amount at a lower price, and suppliers are willing to supply the same for a higher price. Equilibrium is given by the price-quantity pair at which both buyers and sellers are satisfied.
