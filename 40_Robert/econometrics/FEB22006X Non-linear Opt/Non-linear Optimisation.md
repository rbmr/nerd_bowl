- Mathematical Optimization Problems are problems of the form $\min_{\mathbf{x}\in X}f(\mathbf{x})$ where $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function and $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a set.
	- If $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ then we call the problem unconstrained, if $X \neq \mathbb{R}^n$, we call the problem constrained. 
	- If $X$ is a polyhedron and $f$ is linear, the optimization problem is linear.
	- We focus on continuous optimization problems, where $X$ is usually countable.
