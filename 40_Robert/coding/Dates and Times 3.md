I want to write an article on how we can concretely describe points in time, and the time differences between them. 

It shall contain the following topics:

- Tracking the time using the Sun
	- Apparent Solar Time
	- Mean Solar Time
	- Division of days into hours
	- Division of days into seconds
	- [Sidereal Day](https://youtu.be/FUHkTs-Ipfg?si=sid_Dq3k3oIfvERS) Not related to the final definition of a second, but an interesting fact and useful in Astrophysics 
- Tracking the time reliably
	- Reasoning: "Even Mean Solar Day was not reliable"
	- Definition of the SI Second
- Perception of Time
	- Instant (as a specific point in time on the time axis with zero duration, independent of a label, a "freeze frame" of the universe)
	- Absolute Time (per Isaac newton)
	- Proper Time (per Einstein's Relativity)
- Timescales
	- TAI (as best attempt to track the SI second, foundation of modern timekeeping)
	- UT1 (as best attempt to track the Mean Solar Time)
	- UTC (as compromise between the two)
	- Showing and describing the UT1-UTC-TAI difference plot is crucial.
	- Unix Time (as time from an epoch, be concrete on the underlying timescale being used!!! UTC? UT1? TAI? Is the difference in Unix times really the time difference in seconds as measured by an accurate stopwatch?)
- Gregorian Calendar (Going from solar days, to a date)
	- Zeroth year (BC to AD, 1 BC = Year 0, Exiguus)
	- Leap Years
	- Origin of the Months (Roman history, abandonment of ties to the moon)
- Timezones
	- Offset (simple offset from UTC)
	- Timezones (Political, dependent on changes in law, and DST, collected by IANA)
- ISO8601 as the unambiguous label for instants.
